# State Store

StateStores combine asynchronous loading and updating of state into one class.

Example usecases:

1. Batch Paging - manage loading pages and tracking current/total pages.
2. Forms - manage different input values and tracking saving/error states.

## Usage

`@nti/web-core/data` provides hooks for setting up and interacting with stores.

-   [useStore](/docs/data-docs-hooks-usestore--page)
-   [useRead](/docs/data-docs-hooks-useread--page)

```javascript
import { Store, useStore } from '@nti/web-core/data';

class SampleStore extends Store {}

function SampleCmp ({id}) {
	const store = useStore(SampleStore, {id});

	...
}
```

## Setting up a StateStore

### Actions

Actions are methods on the store that push new state into the store.

Actions can either return a simple state update, or an iterator that will push multiple state updates for one action call.

**Action Event Object**

The first argument to actions is the `ActionEventObject` which will have:

-   `prev`: If there is a pending call `prev` will be a promise that fulfills with the result of the call. There is also an `abort` method defined that will abort the previous call.
-   `signal`: An [AbortSignal](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortSignal) instance that will indicate when/if this call has been aborted.
-   `state`: A getter that returns the current state of the store.
-   `params`: A getter that returns the current parameters of the store.

```javascript
class SampleStore extends Store {
	//A simple return value
	increment = Store.Action(() => {
		return {
			count: this.get('count') + 1
		};
	})

	//Iterator return value
	addItem = Store.Action(async* (e, data) => {
		const {items} = e.state;

		yield {items: [...items, {saving: true}]};

		const resp = await saveItem(data);

		yield {items: [...items, data]};
	});
}
```

Actions can run in three different modes:

1. Sequential (`Store.Action`) - where a new call awaits all the previous calls to finish
2. Superseded (`Store.Action.Superseded`) - a new call will abort any pending calls
3. Concurrent (`Store.Action.Concurrent`) - a new call will run immediately and not interfere with previous calls.

### Lifecycles

StateStores have lifecyle actions that are invoked automatically by `useStore`.

1. `load` - Given the current state and parameters of the store load the next state(s) of the store.

    1. initialLoad - triggered when `useStore` mounts a new store instance. Will only run if load has not been called before for the instance.
    2. reload - triggered by `setParams` if params changed. Will only run if load has been run at least once before.

2. `unload` -
3. `setParams` - Push new params into the store and trigger a reload.

#### Lifecycle Hooks

StateStore hooks are methods that get called by the store at certain points in it's lifecycle. Similar to React's `useEffect` StateStore hooks can return a cleanup method to remove any listeners etc.

1. `onInitialized` - Called by the initial load of the store. The cleanup is called when the store unloads.
2. `onStateUpdate` - Called when new state is pushed into the store. The cleanup is called the next time state is pushed, or the store unloads.
3. `onParamsUpdate` - Called when new params are set on the store. The cleanup is called when new params are set or the store unloaded.
