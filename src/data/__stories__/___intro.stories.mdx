# Fundamentals: Getting Data

All data starts from the service document. If you have a direct ID, call getObject. If not get a collection
and fetch it’s contents.

Once you have an object, you can traverse further by fetching/acting on its links.

All models implement HasLinks. This interface gives you getLink, fetchLink, etc.

-   see: service.getObject (useObject, NTObject)
-   see: HasLinks.fetchLink (useLink)

## Paging, Sorting, Filtering

Some links in the system return collections of items. Most of these can be filtered and divided into sub views
we often call batches. This is often achieved by simply appending the appropriate parameters to the link. (eg:
`fetchLink(‘contents’, {batchSize: 10, batchStart: 0})`). Searching/Filtering is often just a search param, or
a named predefined filter. And sort, often a combination of field name & direction.

You can supply these parameters to the fetch yourself OR (and preferred) you can use a helper. We have defined
a system that normalizes these parameters such that defaults line up with most common query parameters used.

## DataView (idea)

This component sets up a context object that will manage and map query parameters to consumable normalized names.
Allowing them to be set and consumed. useLink if called within this context will inherit the context values except
where provided by direct argument input is given. [maybe we name the context and supply a name to match?]
